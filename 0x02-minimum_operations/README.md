# Minimum Operations to Get n H Characters

This problem involves finding the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly n 'H' characters in a text file with a single 'H' character using only two available operations: Copy All and Paste.

## Problem Statement

Given a text file with a single character 'H' and two available operations - Copy All and Paste - the problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

For example, given n = 9, the minimum number of operations needed to get 9 'H' characters in the file is 6.

## Solution

The solution to this problem involves a recursive approach. We can observe that the number of 'H' characters can only be increased by copying and pasting the existing 'H' characters in the file. Initially, we have one 'H' character in the file. Let's say we have x 'H' characters at any point in time, and we need to increase the number of 'H' characters to n.

If we paste one 'H' character at a time, we will need x-1 operations to paste x 'H' characters, and then we will have 2x 'H' characters. We can repeat this process until we get n 'H' characters.

If we paste all x 'H' characters at once, we will need only two operations to get 2x 'H' characters. We can repeat this process until we get n 'H' characters.

Thus, we can recursively apply these two operations and choose the minimum number of operations required to get n 'H' characters.

The solution can be implemented in any programming language that supports recursion. Here's an example implementation in Python:

```python
def minOperations(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return minOperations(n//i) + i
    return n
